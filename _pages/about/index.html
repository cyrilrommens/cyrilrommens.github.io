<!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40/loose.dtd"> <html><body> <p>I am a PhD student in the EU-funded doctoral network ‘<a href="https://www.beyondtheedge.network/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BeyondTheEdge</a>’ at the Complex Systems and Networks Laboratory (<a href="https://cosnet.bifi.es/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">COSNET</a>), Institute for Biocomputation and Physics of Complex Systems (<a href="https://bifi.es/team/rommens-cyril-jean-charles/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">BIFI</a>), University of Zaragoza, Spain.</p> <p>I hold a MSc in Computational Physics of Complex Systems from the University of Amsterdam (2022-2024), where I focused on emergent phenomena in complex systems with a thesis on Free Energy of Simplicial Complexes in Functional Brain Networks. Simultaneously, I completed a research internship at the Bilbao Center for Applied Mathematics (2024), working with Bayesian inference, information homology, and topological data analysis of brain networks.</p> <p>Additionally, I hold a BSc in Physics and Astronomy and a BSc in Medical Natural Sciences from VU University Amsterdam (2017-2021), and a minor in Space Physics from The Arctic University of Norway (2022-2023). As a PhD student under Prof. Yamir Moreno at BIFI, I study the physics of high-order interactions in complex systems.</p> <p>I am highly interested in studying complexity using tools from dynamical systems theory and multivariate information theory. Specifically, I am exploring how multivariate information measures capture high order structures by analysing dynamics of coupled oscillators on hypergraphs. Gaining knowledge on these topics will allow us to better understand and better study both micro- and macroscopic behaviours of complex systems. One of my main applicational interests is studying how information is processed and stored in biological versus artificial intelligence systems. However, understanding these techniques is profitable for many other complex systems, like evolutionary processes in theoretical biology.</p> <p>In addition to my passion for physics, I am also crazy about music and even make my own with the Dutch Post-Punk group <a href="https://shaemless.nl" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Shaemless</a>. The rest of my free time is spent on boxing and film. I look forward to connecting!</p> </body></html>
